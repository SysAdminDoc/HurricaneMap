# Changelog

All notable changes to HurricaneMap.

## Unreleased

- **Track animation** (opt-in via "Play track animation" button on every storm): spinning hurricane glyph + translucent wind-field disk traveling the full HURDAT2 track. Glyph and wind-field both resize live with current Saffir-Simpson category. Bottom-center control bar with play/pause/restart, a scrubber, speed selector (0.5×/1×/2×/4×), live HUD (timestamp + status + wind), and close.
- **📡 Archived NEXRAD radar — full-storm timeline, baked into the repo.** Every storm from August 1995 onward ships with every in-coverage 6-hourly track frame as a local PNG (~512 MB across 1700+ frames in 139 storm folders). Click 📡 next to any landfall and the loop animates the storm's complete U.S. passage from genesis-in-coverage to dissipation, with the map auto-panning to follow the eye. Katrina '05 plays back 22 frames over five days. Frames not in the local archive transparently fall back to live IEM URLs. Tool now works fully offline after `git clone`.
- New scraper: `scripts/scrape_radar.py` with `--cadence`, `--hurricane-only`, `--major-only`, `--landfalls-only`, `--start`, `--end`, `--force`, `--concurrency`, `--dry-run` flags. See README "Refreshing the radar archive".
- Storage layout: `data/radar/<Name>-<Year>/t_<UTC>.png` + `data/radar/manifest.json`.
- Replaced placeholder logo with proper hurricane-spiral branding.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-03

Initial release.

- HURDAT2 preprocessor (`scripts/preprocess_hurdat2.py`) parses both Atlantic and Eastern Pacific best-track files, attributes landfalls to U.S. states via point-in-polygon against U.S. Census state boundaries, and emits three JSON datasets:
  - `landfalls.json` — flat list of every U.S. landfall event (596 storms, 760 events).
  - `storms.json` — full track + metadata for every U.S.-landfalling storm.
  - `stats.json` — by-state, by-decade, by-category, and cold-spot roll-ups.
- Inferred-landfall detection: catches Iniki '92 on Kauai and other Hawaii/Pacific landfalls that don't carry an `L` marker in HURDAT2. Uses mid-segment interpolation when the 6-hour track crosses a small island between synoptic times.
- Pacific-basin geographic guard: EPac inferred landfalls restricted to coastal Pacific states (HI/CA/OR/WA/AK) to prevent false positives in landlocked Arizona / New Mexico from EPac storms tracking up through Mexico.
- Interactive Leaflet map with dark Catppuccin Mocha theme, glassmorphism panels, color-graded storm tracks by per-segment intensity.
- Per-storm details panel with Wikipedia, YouTube, NOAA Tropical Cyclone Report, and NHC archive quicklinks.
- Statistics panel: state hotspot rankings, decade trends, category breakdown, cold-spot list (coastal states with no recorded hurricane-strength landfall).
- Filters: year range (1851–2025), Saffir-Simpson category toggles, state filter, name/year search.
- PWA manifest + viewport/theme-color meta tags.
